Here I tend to collect any generic Qt related code, for use in various GUI projects.

#### Installation

Qt should generate a proper Makefile when you build the project, so I recommend just doing **make install** afterwards, on Unix like systems. The library will be installed in */usr/local* and ready for use.
Keep the Makefile to be able to **make uninstall**, or alternatively use **checkinstall** if it is available on your system.
